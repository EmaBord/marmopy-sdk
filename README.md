# Marmopy-sdk

# Description
Marmopy-sdk helps python developers to consume Marmo Relayer.

# Simple Summary
Allowing users to sign messages to show intent of execution, but allowing a third party relayer to execute them is an emerging pattern being used in many projects. 
This pattern simplifies the integration with any Ethereum based platform. 
Marmo relayer: (https://github.com/ripio/marmo-relayer). 

# Abstract
### User pain points:
> - Users don't want to think about ether
> - Users want to be able to pay for transactions using whatever they have 
> - Users donâ€™t want to download apps/extensions (at least on the desktop) to connect to their apps

### Configure SDK
```python
from marmopy import DefaultConf

DefaultConf.ROPSTEN.as_default()
```

### Create a Marmo wallet
```python
from marmopy import Wallet

wallet = Wallet("Your private key here")
print(wallet.address) # This is your Marmo wallet address!

```

### Build a intent
```python
from marmopy import Intent, IntentAction, DefaultConf

class Contract:
    def __init__(self,contractAddress):
        self.contractAddress = contractAddress
        
    @IntentAction
    def transfer(self, to='address', value='uint256') : return 'bool'
    

erc20 = Contract("0x2f45b6fb2f28a73f110400386da31044b2e953d4")  #example of ERC20 contract with IntentActions injections. 
intentAction = erc20.transfer("0x7F5EB5bB5cF88cfcEe9613368636f458800e62CB", 0)

intent = Intent(intent_action = intentAction)
```


### Sign an relay intent
```python
signedIntent = wallet.sign(intent)
signedIntent.relay("<Relayer URL>")
```
